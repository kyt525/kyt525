Hi, I’m Kathryn Thompson.

I’m majoring in Electrical Engineering and am interested in learning more about 
coding, nanotechnology, EM fields, signal processing, and electrically powered 
transportation systems. 

I’m currently learning Assembly, C programming, and breadboarding basics.

I’m seeking an internship to broaden my experience in engineering fields.
